				<h1></br>Why Prayaana ?</h1>
				<hr>
				<strong><em><p>So, why is Prayaana needed ? Are we just another “feminist” organization?</p>
				<p>There are immense women empowerment initiatives who works on grassroot levels or work on women safety, sexual abuse, domestic violence , girl child education, rural women upliftment etc.  Why do we need Prayaana Labs which functions for educated women / girls and what difference can we make?</p></em></strong>
				<p>To answer this, we need to understand some current contexts . So, here we go.</p>
				<p>Beware: Shameful statistics coming up!</p></br> 
				<p>Well, its been 71 yrs since India got independence and our economy still have less than 30% as women workforce compared to China and Brazil with over 65-70% . In 2017, India fell 21 places on the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap index to 108 – far below the global average and much behind its neighbours China and Bangladesh. In 2016, India’s rank was 87. The Global Gender Gap Report ranks 144 countries on the progress they have made towards gender parity in four areas – health, education, economics and politics. </p>
				<p><h3>Drastic drop in Women Workforce</h3></p>
				<p>In the India Development Report released on May 2017, the World Bank said that the country had one of the lowest female participation in the workforce , ranking 120th among 131 countries for which data was available. While overall job creation has been limited, most of the new ones have been grabbed by men given the social norms, the report said.  What is worrisome is the fact that the participation level has been dropping since 2005, despite having 42% women who are graduates.</p>
				<p>And what are the reasons why women quit workforce? Or in some cases do not even enter workforce? We could attribute it to predictable social norms in  India: marriage, motherhood, vexed gender relations and biases, and patriarchy.</p>
				<p>But they may not be the only reasons. Marriage, for example, does affect the rate of participation of women in the workforce. The report says that  in villages, the workforce participation rate of married women has been found to be higher than that of unmarried women - whereas in the cities, the situation is reversed. Now, this is even more alarming. Why are city dweller educated girls not able to take up jobs?</p>
				<p>Are our girls ending up as housewives and probably a job seeker who tries to ask her recruiter for easy job timings,  location preferences and so many other conditions, such that the recruiter then decides that a male candidate is better? </p>
				<p><h3>Early Marriage </h3></p>
				<p>The average age of marriage for a girl in India is 22 years where as it is 27 years in  US, 30 years in UK and 24 years in China. Most girls get married immediately after their education without even entering their first job. Early marriage brings in responsibility of early child rearing , early health concerns and in many cases, career often takes back seat for several years until the children are grown up. Meanwhile, the educated women loses career skills and ends up with redundant skills which prevents her to take up a job even after the break. And in India, marriage is primarily a family decision and hence most girls chose to get married to avoid societal questioning . Meanwhile, women in other developed countries ensure that they pursue their career and attain a middle level career before taking a marriage decision or maternity break . This helps in easier come back later. </p>
				<p><h3>Maternity matters</h3></p>
				<p>India's labour courts received more than 900 complaints of denial of maternity benefits by employers between 2008 and 2012. But most working women, when denied maternity benefits, do not go to court, they just stop working. A survey of 1,000 women working in the capital, Delhi, and its neighboring areas found that only 18-34% of married women continued working after having a child. We are not aware of similar studies in other parts of the country. Mothers traditionally has the responsibility of  bringing up children in India. Few employers provide flexible working hours or creche facilities, so many working mums end up quitting their jobs after having children.</p>
				<p><h3>Guilt Issues</h3></p>
				<p>Even women who have family support or can afford to pay for child care have a lot of guilt. This is because of the social conditioning of women that their responsibility is to bring up children. In many cases, women stop working because her in laws / husband says that “She is career minded and doesn’t have concerns for baby”.</p>
				<p>Even mothers with grown up kids face difficulties in managing kid’s education, cooking and managing household responsibilities along with their career. So, they choose to quit their careers so that they can manage their husband’s schedule and kids’ schedules. If they don’t , they start feeling  guilty.</p>
				<p><h3>Entry / Re-entry barriers</h3></p>
				<p>Unlike the West, in India it is very common for employers to probe the marital status and family situation from a woman seeking a job. It is a big consideration in selection and if not explicitly stated, there are hidden recruitment agendas given to recruiters to not process women resumes. For unmarried girls, chances of quitting job after marriage and for married women, chances of maternity are a big no for many companies.</p>
				<p>According to the world bank report (stated above), women entrepreneurs typically create more jobs for women but in India the number is few. The sixth economic census, released by ministry of statistics and programme implementation (April 2016), presents a worrisome picture of the status of women entrepreneurs in the country. The survey shows that women constitute only 13.76% of the total entrepreneurs, i.e., 8.05 million out of the 58.5 million entrepreneurs.Of these, a high percentage fall into MSME segment and in Kerala , Kudumbasree has set a model of small scale enterprises around self help groups. However, we are still lagging in the case of professionally qualified women in business.  According to Mastercard Index of Women Entrepreneurs (March 2017) , India scored an overall 41.7 points, ranking 49 among 54 economies globally with comparatively low in Women Business Ownership percentages. The index uses 12 indicators and 25 sub-indicators in 54 economies across Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, North America, Latin America and Europe, representing 78.6 percent of the world’s female labour force.</p>
				<p>It said India presents lower opportunities for women to assume leadership roles, participation in the workforce or engagement in entrepreneurial activities – a disparity that explain the low scores for Business Ownership by Women in the country.</p>
				<p>A regulation was passed in 2015 that every listed company in India should have a woman director on the board. But studies show poor implementation of the rule. Data provider Prime Database in a report in 2016 said that 56 NSE-listed companies did not meet the criteria. Several government-run listed companies were  part of this list of 56. One reason cited was lack of suitable candidates (which we don’t believe to be true!) </p>
				</br>
				<strong>
				<p>Given the above context, we at Prayaana Labs are now striving in our own small way to help the girls and women after career break to re-enter their field. We are an organization of the women, for the women and by the women. We have Prayaana Mentors, Prayaana Trainers and  Prayaana Ambassadors guiding the Prayaana Associates to become Prayaana Fellows . All fellows become eligible to attain internships and work from campus / home options until they become ready to take up full time job options. </p>
				<p>India needs more women workforce – not just at entry level but also in the board room. </p>
				<p>Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, Beti ko Kaam karne do, Beti ko leader banao !</p>
				<p>Become a Prayaana Fellow! Kick Start your career. Become a Leader.
