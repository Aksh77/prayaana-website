					<p>People around me often ask why I work on girl's employability and career building. And why is Prayaana Labs  meant only for girls. And why is my office full of girls and why I don’t hire men. Isn’t this gender inequality that I am denying opportunity to capable men? </p>
					<p>Now, you may call this a prejudice but as a woman who built my career and business facing great obstacles balancing between aspirations and family expectations, I felt that I need to do something for girls like me who would want to be in career but lack support system. It was a thought which was built not in a day but through years of difficult circumstances that I faced.  For eg: I had to quit my first job, because my employer offered to transfer me to a remote location if I wish to retain my job and this was when I had a baby of 6 months. At another instance, I was offered a great job in a premium bank. But due to delayed recruitment processes which lasted for more than an year , by the time I was asked to join, I was 9 months pregnant and the posting was at a remote location away from family.  After taking a break, it took me around 4 years to restart my career wherein I would have sent out atleast 500 job applications .Despite having the qualifications and skillsets I was denied opportunities due to the fact that  I  wasn’t “working” and I had small babies to take care. Probably my recruiters felt that I may be a “bad hire” with these burdens.  However, thanks  to these denials, I decided to work on my career more strongly. I enrolled for higher education , updated my skills, started freelancing as well as working online. These helped me to land a full time job as a college faculty which further helped me to understand the problems that women/ young girls face in entering or working for their career. Now years down the lane, being a "woman entrepreneur" I prefer girls for the reason that if I am able to provide career entry / re-entry to a few girls / women, I would be helping those girls to become start their career. Thereby ,I am directly helping them to become skilled, to become self-confident and earn money. And according to m , empowerment for women is these three things primarily. </p>
					<p>I have been following this principle ever since I plunged into entrepreneurship four years back ( with just one or two males joining in between and subsequently leaving my company)</p>
					<p>My interactions and being a “boss” for girls helped me realize certain characteristics of female employees.</p>
					<p>1. <strong>Young Girls are afraid not to perform but of the societal expectations</strong></p>
					<p>Young girls are equally good at routine tasks as well as creative tasks (provided, they are given such opportunity) . They also possess leadership qualities and can multitask .They are willing to take risks and stretch to attain performance levels . However, they still shy away from roles involving travel or meeting people (not because they are innately like that .But because they are afraid of the society )</p>
					<p>2. <strong>Some girls have wrong job expectations and are not serious about a career. </strong></p>
					<p>Educated girls from rural areas are found to have  higher aspiration levels and more committed to the work given. But in most cases, they lack necessary skill sets especially soft skills. Whereas  girls from affluent families or city dwellers tend to have higher ambitions  and, in some cases, unrealistic expectations of a job. In some cases, I was surprised to note that it was professionally qualified girls from affluent families who had a casual attitude to their job and treated it as a stop-gap arrangement until they got married. A “time-pass” so to say!</p>
					<p>3. <strong>Place of work is a matter of importance for many girls (and their parents!)</strong></p>
					<p>Many times, it’s not the girls, but their parents / spouse who inhibit or lay down unnecessary conditions towards their work/working conditions. It is they who ask the girls to resign the jobs for reasons like - “company is exploiting you”, “company is not providing transport” , “company is not giving perks” , “company is not safe “ , “do not travel by bus “ , “do not go alone” etc. There have been several instances when the girls have been truthful - when they confessed that they “lied” to their parents / husband so that they could do something as part of their work or travel to attend a meeting.  My sizeable team of girls quit my company in early 2017 when my company was asked to move out of our office in Infopark - because their parents didn’t want them to work for a company which did not have an office in Infopark  (And this incident led to the downfall of my company; it took me nearly 6 months to rebuild the team and set up a decent office).</p>
					<p>4. <strong>Societal expectation on a girl’s type based on her job places unwanted stress for the girl.</strong></p>
					<p>Our society still has certain stereotypical job roles for a girl ,despite the fact that a boy and girl are undergoing the same education. For eg: Its OK for a boy with an MBA qualification to do a sales job but a girl with the same qualification is ridiculed – “how can a girl from a decent family do sales?” . Further stereotyping like its better for girls to take up a comfortable job with less pressure (Banking, teaching  or Govt job is a “safe option” ) and “Good girls” do not travel with male colleagues (It will affect your reputation and who will marry a girl who travels with men all the time? )</p>
					<p>5. <strong>Getting married ? – Girl should resign the job, says the society. </strong></p>
					<p>It is disheartening to note that none of my “fresher girls” who joined my company and got married continued after marriage. The moment marriage is fixed, family asked them to resign their job. And despite me trying to convince them , the girls were unable to convince their parents why they could continue their job.</p>
					</br>
					<p>These reasons sometimes became impediments  and created difficulties for me as a businessperson because I had a high rate of attrition and many times delays in work schedules because the girls want to leave home early. There were occasions when my friends advised me to hire male staff and get things done rather than depending on girls. However, I decided to continue. I also researched and found out reasons why I need to pursue this mission and promote this cause of employing more women workforce. My research led me to conceptualize Prayaana in early 2017. Me along with my Trainer friend Keziah Thomas, did some pilot training and orientation for a small group of girls and helped them with placement. We found that it does make a great difference when a lady trainer trains a girl in employability skills and helps in career orientation at an early stage of career. All these learning helped me to launch Prayaana Labs in Oct 2017. Our pilot batch girls were all successfully placed or provided internship with.</p>
					<p>Prayaana Fellowship Program is designed keeping these things in mind and aims at shattering the societal gender stereotyping on what type of a career a girl should choose. We are building skillsets and an enabler ecosystem which will help the girls to collaborate , innovate and work together.</p>
					<p>In January 2018, we are taking this concept to a state wide initiative by setting up Prayaana Lab hubs at various campuses who are ready to support girl students in their employability and thereby lifelong empowerment . Prayaana Labs aims at empowering over 500 girls this year by providing the most needed self-confidence and career orientation along with providing them internship or part time jobs. We believe that employability can be attained only by getting employed and this must happen while they are in the campus and girls need this more than boys who gets chances otherwise also.</p>
					<p>Even now, in India, we keep talking about women safety and harassment issues. My take is this :<br><strong><em>Empowerment for a girl is not just about the safety of her body but also about allowing her mind to perform and be productive!</em></strong></p>
					<p>And woman empowerment begins at one thing : Financial empowerment and that in turn begins at being employable and skillful!</p>
					<p>We are a social initiative and a non-profit organization working towards Career building of every educated girl in this nation. No educated girl should limit her selves behind the four walls of the kitchen. We seek the support of every well-wisher to this important social cause that we are trying to address in our own small way.</p>
